# Arcades Management

ðŸš¨ *discontinued*

*Easy to configure, it is only to change each ID of each `channel`, `category`, `emojis`, `roles`, `messages`*

> you can change everything from the folder called **[config](https://github.com/k4itrun/discord-js-arcades-management-official/tree/master/config)**


### Recommendations

To change all the IDS more quickly you can do a global search with Visual Studio Code and do global replacement to avoid errors ðŸ¤™

### Important 

To save the bot's database on your server use the `,ensure` command to avoid errors
